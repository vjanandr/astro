Notes:
======
a. The kind of glass used for the prisms is usually either BAK-4 (Barium Crown Glass) or BK-7 (Borosilicate Glass).
   BK-7 is considered inferior to BAK-4, but for most practical purposes.
b. ED glass - this is Extra-low Dispersion glass, with virtually no chromatic aberration.
c. In order to avoid stray reflections and scattering of light within the light path, binocular glass surfaces are usually 
   protected by anti-reflective coatings. You might come across the terms Multi-Coated and Fully Multi-Coated in this context. 
   Multi-coated binoculars usually have their objectives and oculars coated. The Fully Multi-Coated kind have anti-reflective 
   coatings on all glass-to-air surfaces. FMC binoculars are preferable to the other kind, but are also more expensive.
   Avoid binoculars with Ruby (or similar visibly red) coatings. These coatings work by filtering out the red parts of the spectrum, 
   rendering them pretty much useless for astronomical use.
d. Binoculars come in two broad constructions - Porro-Prism and Roof-Prism. Porro-Prism binoculars are the most common kind. 
   Roof-Prism constructions are supposed to have lower light losses. Between the two, Porro-Prism binoculars are definitely 
   more cost-effective.
   

Recommended Binos:
=================
Olympus 10x50s
Nikon Active EX 10x50 
Celestron SkyMaster 15x70
Oberwerk 25x100 

Tripod:
a monopod/ball-head combination like the following is more useful than a tripod
